# Counting Cats Python Program
![Cats love numpurrs.](https://github.com/N-J-Miller/Week_20/blob/bd7adc80c535b29dacf9dafbfe271eccb73ccb59/numpurrs.JPG)

I have created a python program, meant to be executed from the terminal, that will accept a .txt file as input. The program will then return a list of words and punctuation characters in the input file and a count of their instances.

Included in this repository is a sample text file: 'cats_text.txt'.

Let's count together! (Because cats *love* numpurrrs...)

## To execute program:

**Pre-requisite**
*Ensure you can access the following necessary files and folders in this repository: counting_cats.py, map_reduce folder, and cats_txt.txt (or any other .txt file you wish.)*

  1. Open the terminal in your preferred vehicle. This demonstration features VS Code.

  2. Navigate to the folder containing the program. *Optional: verify you are in the right directory with command 'ls' as shown:*

  3. Execute the program by concatenating the input.txt file with the program.py file by entering the command:

`cat <input.txt filepath>|./counting_cats.py`

  4. Marvel at the output!

 **Note for VS Code**
 *If you cannot revel in the full glory of the expected output, check the Scrollback settings in VS Code. By default, you are limited to scrolling back 1000 lines per terminal session. Go ahead and bump this session way up! ðŸ˜Ž*

#### I hope you've enjoyed this program. Programs like this are important components of any Natural Language Processing toolkit. When dealing with natural language, the volume of data becomes its own problem. Being able to execute a few processing steps programatically is vital for computational viability.

 ### Thank you for going on this journey with me!
